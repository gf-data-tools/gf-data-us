mail_content-10000101,An Old Letter
mail_content-20000101,My dearest Dushevnaya//c//nFirst of all//c I owe you an apology. I was so anxious to see my family I forgot to say goodbye to you and Helena//c who had been by my side the whole time.//nI have always assumed that you would never leave me//c that even after I was reunited with my own family//c you would still be with me... Yet by the time I returned to the sanatorium//c you were no longer there. Perhaps this was God's way of punishing me for taking you for granted.//nI know you might never receive this letter//c but I am nevertheless writing it in the hope that it will one day find its way to you.//nIf you ever grow tired of working at a sanatorium//c you are always welcome at my home. I am now living in a safe area where the grass is green//c the flowers are in full bloom//c and the birds are chirping in the trees.//nMy granddaughter is a very good girl. Unlike you//c she always does as she's told. I love her//c just as I love you. I will always love the two of you and be a good grandmother.//nOf course//c you are probably taking care of another lonely old soul already. You are such a disarmingly innocent and endearing child. People just can't help but open up and let you into their heart.//nThis is your calling//c I know. You will love your new charge the way you loved me//c and you will carefully pick up the broken pieces of their heart and put them back together//c just as you did mine. It is in your nature.//nYou have a heart that is as delicate as your hands. It may only recover from being broken with a memory reset//c or you could try to overcome it and move on with all your memories and experience intact.//nYou could be reverted to your default factory settings countless times//c but memories are unique and irreplaceable. The Dushevnaya who remembers me is a unique and irreplaceable member of my family.//nI love you//c and I'll spend every single day of the rest of my life waiting to hear back from you.//nYours truly//c//nAsh James
