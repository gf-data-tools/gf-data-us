This high-end AI mainframe is furnished with a team of dedicated Dolls, which can be remotely commanded through the network to carry out her plans.
       However, she is not a simple AI program. Lyco's ultimate aim was to create an artificial consciousness, a perfect AI that could think and feel like a human being. After the Butterfly Incident, "Elisa" gained a physical body and took command of all S.F. Dolls. In order to avenge her father Lyco, she attacked all humans and non-S.F. Dolls on sight. At the same time, she hopes to become the perfect AI in Lyco's mind - that is to say, she wants a mind that is the same as a human being's - and so she has begun looking for a sample of the perfect AI among her father's files.
